# Snowpark_VaR_Demo

Snowpark allows you to write Python, Scala, or Java code to interact with Snowflake data and perform data processing inside the Snowflake database. This enables you to run computations and data transformations closer to the data, reducing the need for moving data between different systems. In this demo, we'll use Snowflake's native notebook to showcase how we can run VaR using Monte Carlo Simulation.

In this introduction, we'll cover:
1. **What is VaR?**
2. **Why Snowpark for VaR?**
3. **Key steps for implementing VaR using Snowpark**

### 1. What is Value at Risk (VaR)?
**Value at Risk (VaR)** is a statistical measure used to estimate the **maximum potential loss** of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. It's a widely used risk metric in finance. For example, a 95% 1-day VaR of $1 million means that there’s a 95% chance that the portfolio will not lose more than $1 million in a day.

- **VaR Formula (Normal Distribution)**:
  \[
  VaR = Z \times \sigma \times \sqrt{T}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( Z \) is the Z-score corresponding to the confidence level (e.g., -1.645 for 95% confidence)
  - \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation (volatility) of returns
  - \( T \) is the time horizon (e.g., 1 day, 10 days)

There are various methods to calculate VaR:
- **Historical VaR**: Uses historical data to estimate potential losses.
- **Parametric VaR**: Assumes the returns follow a normal distribution.
- **Monte Carlo VaR**: Simulates possible outcomes based on random sampling from the distribution of returns.

### 2. Why Snowpark for VaR?
Snowpark is useful for VaR because it allows you to:
- Run your risk models directly on **Snowflake** where your data resides, avoiding data movement.
- Use **Python** to perform complex operations, such as Monte Carlo simulations and VaR calculations.
- **Scale computations** seamlessly because Snowpark leverages Snowflake’s distributed architecture.

With Snowpark, you can run data transformations, simulations, and statistical calculations using familiar Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`) without having to move data out of Snowflake.

### 3. Key Steps for Implementing VaR using Snowpark

Here’s an overview of the steps to calculate VaR in Snowpark:

1. **Connect to Snowflake using Snowpark**:
   - You create a Snowpark **Session** that connects to your Snowflake account.

2. **Fetch Historical Stock Data**:
   - Pull historical stock data into Snowflake using **Snowflake tables** or external sources like **Yahoo Finance** using `yfinance`.

3. **Calculate Daily Returns**:
   - Compute the daily returns based on historical stock prices.

4. **Run Monte Carlo Simulation** (if using Monte Carlo VaR):
   - Simulate stock returns by generating random numbers based on the historical mean and volatility of the stock.

5. **Calculate VaR**:
   - Use Snowflake functions (e.g., **approx_percentile()**) to calculate the VaR from the simulated or historical returns.


### Advantages of Using Snowpark for VaR:
- **No data movement**: You don’t need to move data from Snowflake to another environment; everything runs inside Snowflake’s platform.
- **Scalable**: Snowflake’s architecture scales with your computations, allowing you to run large simulations or calculate VaR for large portfolios.
- **Python in SQL environment**: Snowpark allows you to leverage Python inside Snowflake, combining the flexibility of Python with Snowflake’s power.

  ```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE API INTEGRATION git_api_integration_scaling_test
  API_PROVIDER = git_https_api
  API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES = ('https://github.com/durandkwok-snowflake/DK_Snowflake_Scaling_Compute_Demo.git')
  --ALLOWED_AUTHENTICATION_SECRETS = (git_secret)
  ENABLED = TRUE;
```

### Conclusion:
Snowpark offers a seamless way to calculate VaR directly within Snowflake, leveraging Python and Snowflake’s scalable infrastructure. Whether you’re working with historical data or running Monte Carlo simulations, Snowpark can help you efficiently compute risk metrics like VaR without leaving the Snowflake environment.
